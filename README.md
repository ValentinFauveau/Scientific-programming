Thanks to the great technological advances in terms of computing power and storage, engineering problems have been solved at unimaginable scales some years ago. The Biomedical Engineering is of course an area of engineering that has benefited greatly from these advances, which have allow the simulation of biological models at large scales or the development of portable systems capable of measure and analyze different biomedical variables in real time and with great precision.
